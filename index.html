        <p>You’re disgusting. The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take
            out its family. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder
            text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. You're telling the
            enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem
            Ipsum your entire adult life.

            I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by
            far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different?
            We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.
            Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you
            know, shot.

            The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make
            U.S. design jobs non-competitive.

            Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your
            next webpage?! Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of
            Muslim text entering your website. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're
            going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.
            An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack
            Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He
            is so good with these words it's unbelievable.
