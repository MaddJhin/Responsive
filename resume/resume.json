      "summary": "I am a web developer, game designer, armature brewer, and puzzle solver extraordinaire.   I started my own business from the ground up, getting back in the black in less than a year and successfully selling it off. After acquiring an extensive background as an entrepreneur, I transitioned into game production and expanded my skill set to include systems design and game development.   Through game design I discovered how much I loved coding and the logical structure of it. Now Iâ€™ve seen multiple project through, adapting to the situation at hand, wearing multiple hats, and putting my skills as a developer, designer, and producer to use. ",
